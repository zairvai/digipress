Resolvers with None data sources can locally publish events that fire
subscriptions or otherwise transform data without hitting a backend data source.
The value of 'payload' is forwarded to $ctx.result in the response mapping template.

#set($type=$ctx.source["__typename"])
{
    "version": "2017-02-28",
    "payload": "$type"
